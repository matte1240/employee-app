## 🌿 Branching Strategy

We follow a structured branching model:

```
dev (development)
  ↓ merge when ready
staging (pre-production)
  ↓ merge when tested
main (production)
  ↓ tag for release
v1.0.0 (release)
```

### Branches
- **`dev`**: Active development. Unstable. No auto-deploy.
- **`staging`**: Pre-production testing. Auto-deploys to Staging server.
- **`main`**: Production code. Stable. Auto-deploys to Production server.

### Workflow
1.  Create a feature branch from `dev`: `git checkout -b feat/my-feature dev`
2.  Commit changes.
3.  Open Pull Request to `dev`.
4.  After approval and merge to `dev`, merge `dev` to `staging` for testing.
5.  Finally, merge `staging` to `main` for production deployment.
